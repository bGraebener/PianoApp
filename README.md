## 1. Introduction

This projects aim is to turn the LEAP Motion controller into a MIDI controller.   
The application will allow the user to play a virtual MIDI instrument using the LEAP Motion controller.
The controller picks up finger tap gestures and the data from the controller
is converted into midi note on event. This event is sent to
a virtual midi driver which in turn will control a virtual instrument.

The rationale to use MIDI instead of audio was to keep flexibility as to what instrument the LEAP Motion controller can
be used for. It is left to the user to decide what sounds to produce with the LEAP Motion controller.
 
This readme explains the architecture of the application and discusses strengths and weaknesses of both the software and the hardware.

## 2. MIDI
MIDI is an abbreviation for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI is a data transfer protocol commonly used for
connecting computers with electronic musical or audio devices. [1]    

In order for the LEAP Motion controller to be used as a MIDI device a MIDI driver is needed. MIDI drivers enable an
operating system to recognise a device as being able to send and receive data using the MIDI protocol.  
The MIDI driver is then used to route the data between devices and applications [2].

Real MIDI interfaces like MIDI keyboards, drums or other MIDI controllers come with a driver specific to the controller 
provided by the manufacturer. 
 
Since the LEAP Motion controller was not intended to be used as a MIDI controller and therefore does not provide a 
MIDI driver, a solution had to be found to enable the operating system and applications like a virtual instrument
to recognise the LEAP Motion controller as a device capable of sending MIDI data.  

The application [**loopMidi**](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) creates a virtual MIDI driver that
can be used by applications to communicate using the MIDI protocol.  This virtual MIDI driver can be targeted by both, the 
application that sends MIDI data and by the virtual MIDI instrument that receives MIDI data. A virtual MIDI port called 
__'PianoApp'__  is created in **loopMidi**. 

There are several different types of messages that can be send over MIDI. For the purpose of this application, only
'Note On' and 'Note Off' messages were used. [3] 'Note On' and 'Note Off' events consist both of three bytes. The first byte
is called header byte and contains the MIDI channel number. The last two bytes are the so-called data-bytes. The first 
data-byte is the key-number. The last byte is the velocity which specifies the force a note was played.

### 2.1 MIDI in the application
The application was written in Java using the language version 8. The Java core library has good support for working
with MIDI.    
The first step in the application is to search the for the MIDI driver in the system with the name '__PianoApp'__. Once
the application found the driver, it attempts to open it and retrieve the MIDI receiver. The MIDI receiver is used to send 
'MIDI Note On' events.

### 2.2 Issues
With the LEAP Motion controller there was no way off specifying when to stop playing a key, since there is no 
'key-released' event hook.  For this application we hard-coded a value of 

## Technologies used:
    1. LEAP Motion controller
    2. loopMidi, a virtual midi driver application , see https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
    3. Tiny Virtual Piano, virtual piano instrument 
   

## Work done so far:
    - installed loopMidi and created virtual midi driver
    - connected virtual piano to midi driver
    - programmed small java application to connect to midi driver and send midi note on and note off 
      events to the virtual piano programatically
    - connected to leap motion device to recognize hands

## Existance of lib and native folders
Leap Motion does not support Java anymore and has removed every easily accessible documentation and source. 

It is not easy to find documentation how to set up a java project and where to get the needed jar and native files. Therefore I decided to include them in the repository. They are under free licence and can be optained from [Leap Motion's website](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop/windows/) in a complicated way.
